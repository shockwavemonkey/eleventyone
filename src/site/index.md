I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation">Digital Transformation</a> (DX) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience">Customer Experience</a> (CX) professional who finds it hard to describe what I do, and how I got here, for a potential employer.

## Don't want to read everything underneath? Here are the key points.
- Turns out I'm an [intrepreneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship) (I only just learned this term) which sounds incredibly pompous but so is having a website named after yourself so I guess I'm all in
- I'm not self-made. I've worked for incredible people and leveraged amazing technology to achieve everything I've ever done
- I've solved problems that weren't my problem at every job I've ever had
- I genuinely like people and want their professional lives to be easier
- I love solving puzzles with technology
- I want to work for someone with a strong vision
- I may not fit in a big business because I really like getting things done

## What do I do for a living?
This is a question I've had trouble with for a long time because what I'm good at didn't really exist 20 years ago. At least not in the way that it works now or the speed at which it changes. Doctor, plumber and accountant are all roles that we inherintly just *understand*. Even modern jobs in the IT space like computer programmer are somewhat understood even if you don't know exactly what that person does on a day-to-day basis.

This might be better worded as "What do you do *well* while you are employed?" as I've had lots of different jobs but I've always gravitated towards DX and CX regardless of KPIs and role descriptions. What I do well is identify and permanently remove or reduce **process friction** for people, using (mostly) digital technology. I'd also like to think that I'm good at other things including communication, problem solving and computer "savvy".

## I've answer a question with a made-up term. What is process friction?
Process friction means something that gets in the way of you moving towards your goals. More speficially, it's something that gets in the way of your ability, experience, and expertise that you use to achieve those goals. In the business world it's called "business friction" and in your personal life I'm honestly not sure what it's called. 

Struggling to remember all of the passwords you have (assuming you are doing what you're supposed to do and having unique passwords for the 300 accounts in your life) and failing to log in to services quickly because you forgot one of them is an example of process friction. LastPass or 1Password is an example of a digital tool that can remove the process friction and allow you to log in. It removes the process friction by eliminating something you are probably not an expert in (remembering 300 unique passwords) and allowing you to more quickly achieve your goal (binge watching Netflix).

## What's an example of process friction that I've resolved?
I worked in a call centre between 2003 and 2007 while at university where my role was answering the phone and providing customer service. Paperwork (faxing, tracking performance) was a major component of each day which with the Microsoft Office suite available seemed like a waste of time. So I created paperless systems that removed the need for paperwork in either by using existing systems and VBA (the MS Office scripting language). It saved each call centre worker ~15 minutes per day and the administrative staff about 2 hours a day.

## That's an example from 15 years ago. Anything more recent?
That's the first example that I can recall professionally, but I've completed dozens of similar projects over the years (check my resume for the ones I could remember). In my current (April 2022) role as a Senior Mining Consultant I've introduced a CRM and the relevant add-ons and plugins to solve several problems around what is a very tight industry where relationships are even more important than normal. And a proposals system. And I tried to change the time management and accounting systems too but without the remit it's tough to get the buy in.

## Why am I worth giving a shot?
Every single time I've been given the opportunity to work for someone I've risen to the occasion and beyond. When I worked at Coles in high school as a shelf stacker I was chosen to run the back dock. When I worked part-time at a call centre as a university student I was promoted twice and was nominated for national awards in Innovation. When I worked in retail I was tapped to join an online startup side project. My work in the online startup ended up being implemented in one of Australia's largest retail companies. I started my mining industry career with a health science degree on a 3 month contract and am now one of the top experts in my field.

I'm seeking my next opportunity to rise to the occasion and I hope this self-promotion hasn't gotten in the way. I'm also looking for someone to work for who I trust because I'm not a CEO in training. At my best I'm a COO or a CXO but I'm not quite there yet.
